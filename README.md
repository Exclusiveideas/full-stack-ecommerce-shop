## Introduction
Using the MERN stack, MongoDB, ExpressJs, React and NodeJs, I built a full stack e-commerce web application, Admin dashboard and integrated stripe for payment functionality.

## Stage
The shop is completely built.

Presently I'm developing the admin dashboard.

## Setup 
run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the application.
